UDFs for simulating nuclear reactor core

This UDFs represents an approach how to create boundary condition which utilizes non constant profile. I used it to simulate heat generations 
field in nuclear reactors such as GT-MHR and PWR.

This UDFs can be used to simulate various boundary conditions in various medias.

wall_heat_flux_with_cosine_heat_generation_distribution.c - UDF which I use to simulate heat flux through a coolant channew wall which 
was a part of this research [Research of the influence of intensification of heat transfer on distribution of temperature in the active core of the gas cooled nuclear reactor of the «GT-MHR» project]([https://www.google.com](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/891/1/012069))



Hope this repo will help somebody.

Best regards.
